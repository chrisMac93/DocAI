# Project Name: DocAI LLM Generator

## Overview

DocAI LLM Generator is a JavaScript-based tool designed to assist developers in generating high-quality documentation for various codebases using large language models (LLMs). By leveraging AI technologies, this project aims to streamline the documentation process, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the DocAI LLM Generator is to provide developers with an easy-to-use utility that can automatically generate descriptive documentation based on existing code. By ensuring that every function and class in the codebase is well-documented, it enhances collaboration and helps enforce best practices in software development.

## Installation

To get started with the DocAI LLM Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docai-llm-generator.git
   cd docai-llm-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**

   Make sure to set up any required environment variables, such as API keys for accessing LLM services, if applicable. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and include the necessary configurations.

## Usage

To generate documentation using the DocAI LLM Generator, follow these instructions:

1. **Run the Tool:**

   Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   node generate.js <path-to-your-codebase>
   ```

   Replace `<path-to-your-codebase>` with the actual path to the directory containing the code you want to document.

2. **Output:**

   The tool will analyze the specified codebase and automatically generate documentation files. The output will be structured and easy to understand, making it simple to integrate into your existing documentation framework.

## Code Structure

The core functionality of the DocAI LLM Generator resides in `generate.js`, which is designed to:

- Analyze the provided codebase recursively.
- Identify and extract function and class definitions.
- Communicate with large language model APIs to generate descriptive comments and documentation.
- Output the generated documentation to specified files or formats.

### Key Components

- **Function/Method Calls:**
  Each function and method is defined clearly with structured comments above them. This ensures that both the functionality and its purpose are easily understandable.

- **Class Definitions:**
  Class structures are organized with well-defined properties and methods, allowing for intuitive understanding of their roles within the project.

- **Clear Comments:**
  Each section of the code is sufficiently commented to explain its function and any complex logic, thus aiding future maintainers in navigating the codebase efficiently.
