# DocAI - Documentation Automation Tool

## Overview

DocAI is a powerful documentation automation tool designed to streamline the process of generating and maintaining documentation for codebases. By intelligently scanning a project’s files, it identifies changes and updates relevant documentation automatically. This helps developers save time and ensures that documentation is always in sync with the codebase, leading to improved project clarity and maintainability.

## Purpose

The primary goal of DocAI is to facilitate efficient documentation practices in software development. By automating the documentation workflow, DocAI allows developers to focus more on coding rather than managing documentation, significantly enhancing productivity and collaboration among team members.

## Features

- **Automatic Change Detection**: Scans the codebase and detects changes, helping to ensure that documentation remains accurate and up-to-date.
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize the behavior of DocAI through configuration files.
- **Git Integration**: Works seamlessly with Git to trigger documentation updates on relevant commit hooks.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Utilizes a caching system to optimize the scanning process, reducing overhead for subsequent scans.
- **Modular Commands**: Supports modular commands for initializing projects, scanning codebases, and generating documentation summaries.
