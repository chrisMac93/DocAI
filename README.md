# README for DocAI Codebase Scanner

## Project Overview

The DocAI Codebase Scanner is a tool designed for developers to analyze their codebase effectively. Its primary purpose is to detect changes within the code and summarize relevant content, helping maintain documentation accuracy and ensuring that important updates are not overlooked. Clear function and class definitions, alongside detailed comments, are crucial in ensuring that the tool operates smoothly and enhances collaboration among developers.

## Features

- **Codebase Scanning**: Scans the code for modifications and updates.
- **Change Detection**: Identifies and logs changes in the codebase.
- **Documentation Update**: Automatically updates the project’s README file to reflect changes and summaries.
- **Exclusion Patterns**: Prevents specific files from being scanned or included in the updates.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd DocAI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure .gitignore**:
   Make sure that `fileCache.json` is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.

## Usage

To use the DocAI Codebase Scanner, you will primarily interact with the `generate.js` and `scan.js` files. Below are essential functions and their roles:

- **scanCodebase()**: Initiates the scanning process to detect changes.
- **ensureFileCacheInGitignore()**: Checks if the `fileCache.json` is listed in `.gitignore`.
- **detectChanges()**: Monitors the codebase for any modifications from the previous state.
- **summarizeContent(content)**: Produces a summary of the essential aspects of the current codebase.
- **getAllFiles(dirPath, excludePatterns, arrayOfFiles = [])**: Retrieves all relevant files from the specified directory while respecting exclusion patterns.
- **isExcluded(filePath, excludePatterns)**: Validates if a file path matches any exclusion patterns.
- **updateReadme(doc)**: Updates the README.md file with new information deduced from the codebase scan.

### Running the Tool

To execute the scanner, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node generate.js
```

This command triggers a series of tasks including scanning the codebase, detecting changes, summarizing the content, and updating the README.md file.

## Comments and Documentation

It is vital to maintain clear comments within the code to describe the purpose and functionality of each function. Proper documentation aids in:

- Enhancing understanding for new contributors and team members.
- Facilitating easier debugging and maintenance.
- Ensuring clarity about the workflow and functionality within the project.
