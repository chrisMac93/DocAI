# Documentation Updates for README

## Overview of Changes

### Git Configuration

- **Husky Integration**: The project now includes Husky for managing Git hooks. This enhances the development workflow by allowing specific scripts to run at various Git lifecycle events (e.g., pre-commit, pre-push). 
    - Ensure to follow the setup instructions for Husky if you're contributing to the project.
  
### Cache Management

- **Cache Functions Added**: Functionality has been added to manage cache effectively:
    - `getFileHash(content)`: Computes a hash for the given content.
    - `loadCache()`: Loads cached files.
    - `saveCache(cache)`: Saves the current state of cache.
    - `updateCache(filePath, content)`: Updates the cache with the new content.
    - `hasFileChanged(filePath, content)`: Checks if the content of a file has changed compared to the cached version.

### Scanning Functionality

- **New Scanning Functions**: The scanning features have been enhanced to improve the detection of changes in the codebase:
    - `scanCodebase()`: Initiates a scan of the current codebase.
    - `ensureFileCacheInGitignore()`: Ensures that the cache files are listed in .gitignore.
    - `detectChanges()`: Identifies changes in the scanned files.
    - `summarizeContent(content)`: Summarizes the content of the scanned files.
    - `getAllFiles(dirPath, excludePatterns, arrayOfFiles)`: Recursively retrieves all files while respecting the exclude patterns.
    - `isExcluded(filePath, excludePatterns)`: Determines whether a file should be excluded based on defined patterns.
    - `updateReadme(doc)`: Updates the README with the results or structure of the scanning operation.

## Setup Instructions

- ### Husky
  - If you haven't already, install Husky by following the instructions on the [Husky GitHub page](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#).
  - Make sure that the hooks are correctly set up to automate pre-commit checks.

## Contributing

- **Cache Management**: When contributing, please utilize the caching functions to enhance performance and ensure that the caching mechanism is respected in your code changes.
- **Scanning Features**: The new scanning functionality is vital for keeping track of changes and maintaining code quality. Please familiarize yourself with these functions before making contributions.

## Example Usage

- An example of how to use the scanning functions and cache management functions will be provided in the upcoming sections to help developers understand practical applications.

## Conclusion

These updates enhance the functionality and maintainability of the project, and contributors are encouraged to review these changes and integrate them into their workflow effectively. Further documentation will be added as features evolve.
